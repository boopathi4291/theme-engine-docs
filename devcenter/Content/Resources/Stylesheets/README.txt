///***  VOLUSION BOOTSWATCH  ***\\\

Volusion supports and employs the use of Bootstrap and Bootswatch themes for redesigning content and sites on the fly. The files include:

bootstrap.css -- boostrap styles
bootstrap.min.css -- minified boostrap styles
theme.less -- LESS theme styles
variables.less -- LESS variables for the styles such as colors, fonts, tables, components

These files currently use the Kitchen Sink Volusion theme: https://cdn.rawgit.com/volusion/bootstrap/master/_templates/kitchensink.html

These are kept locally for now, but may need to be relative path set or associated to the link. Also considering creating a simple @import for the css using the weblink. Issues arise from the target generation process in Flare.

*** IMPORTANT ***
The path of the CSS and generation need to be determined when delivering the content for the Volusion Dev Center.
